# Part B

Ball Bounce Game:

Using the number of steps from part A, the player spawns into the game with more balls
The player then gets a set number of seconds to shake the phone (using gyro) to bounce
the balls agains the edges of the screen as much as possible. Points are calculated based
on the total number of bounces, so more vigorous shaking + more balls = more points!
